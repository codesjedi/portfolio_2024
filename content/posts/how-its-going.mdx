Hello! I'm Enrique Gimenez, a Full Stack Developer with a growing expertise in AI integration. I specialize in building scalable web applications using modern technologies like React, Node.js, and TypeScript, while implementing AI capabilities to enhance solution effectiveness. My focus is on creating robust, innovative applications that combine traditional development with cutting-edge AI features.

My technology journey began in 2016 at Grupo Luminotecnia in technical support, where I developed a strong foundation in understanding user needs and technical problem-solving. In 2019, I established EG Software Factory, working as a freelance developer delivering full-stack solutions. This entrepreneurial venture allowed me to build a diverse portfolio while mastering various technologies and architectural patterns.

My professional path evolved through strategic roles: at Documenta S.A., I specialized in payment systems integration and backend development; at Edge S.A., I focused on API development using Apigee and enterprise-level solutions. At XO Capital, I expanded my expertise as a Full Stack Engineer, developing and maintaining cloud-based applications while integrating AI capabilities across multiple portfolio companies.

Currently at Outlier, I combine my full-stack development skills with AI implementation, building applications that leverage the power of Large Language Models. This role allows me to bridge traditional web development with emerging AI technologies, creating more intelligent and responsive solutions.

My technical toolkit includes:
- Frontend: React.js, Next.js, TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js, Python, Java EE
- Cloud & DevOps: GCP, AWS, Docker
- Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase
- AI Integration: LLM Implementation, Prompt Engineering
- Architecture: Microservices, Serverless

This journey represents more than professional growthâ€”it's about evolving with technology to create solutions that make a real impact. Whether it's developing scalable web applications, integrating AI features, or architecting cloud solutions, each experience has contributed to my comprehensive understanding of modern software development.

I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in web development while exploring new ways to integrate AI capabilities into practical, user-focused solutions.
