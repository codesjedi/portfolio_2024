Hello! My name is Enrique Gimenez. I'm a software engineer focused on crafting efficient, innovative digital solutions. My experience spans across full-stack development, with expertise in modern technologies like React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. I'm passionate about building high-quality, scalable applications that solve real-world problems.

My technology journey began in 2016 at Grupo Luminotecnia, where I started in technical support. This experience laid the foundation for my understanding of user needs and technical problem-solving. In 2019, I took a significant step by launching EG Software Factory, where I began providing comprehensive turnkey solutions as a freelance developer. This venture allowed me to work with various technologies and build custom solutions for clients.

My professional growth continued through roles at Documenta S.A., where I specialized in payment systems integration, and Edge S.A., where I developed REST APIs using Apigee. Currently, at XO Capital, I work as a Software Engineer & Technical Support Manager, handling everything from feature implementation to customer support across multiple portfolio companies.

Throughout this journey, I've built expertise in a wide range of technologies including React, Node.js, Python, Django, cloud platforms (GCP, AWS), Docker, and databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I remain committed to continuous learning and staying updated with the latest developments in web technologies, always aiming to create efficient and user-friendly digital solutions.

This journey has been more than just professional growthâ€”it's been about turning a passion for technology into meaningful solutions that make a difference. Whether it's developing e-commerce platforms, integrating payment systems, or managing technical support, each experience has contributed to my holistic understanding of software development.
